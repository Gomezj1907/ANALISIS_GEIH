# GEIH Analysis
Colombian sociodemographic analysis using the GEIH of colombia
**Repository Name:** GEIH Analysis

**Description:**
This repository contains an analysis of working with the Gran Encuesta Integrada de Hogares (GEIH) dataset. The GEIH is a comprehensive household survey conducted by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) in Colombia. The analysis files can be found in the "dofiles" folder, which includes one file for the analysis itself and another for setting up the database.

To get started, it is recommended to read the documentation provided in the "dofiles" folder. 
The documentation will provide insights into the analysis process and the setup of the database.

The raw monthly data is located in the "raw" folder in CSV format. The folder names have been modified to follow the format "mes_month" to indicate the corresponding month. 
Please note that the original data files in DTA or other formats have been removed from this repository. 
However, they can be downloaded from the official DANE website at [https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/771/get-microdata](https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/771/get-microdata).

In addition to the existing analysis files, I will gradually include code snippets in R to provide more flexibility for performing similar analyses or conducting further exploration.

Please feel free to explore the repository and utilize the provided resources for working with the GEIH dataset. 
If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.
